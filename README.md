# RESTful_Node
Rest API - Node.js
Rest API using plain node.js. NO DEPENDENCIES.

This API do a health check every 1 minute for some given URL. You can create an account, and every account can has 5 "checks". The project uses tokens to validate each user.

About the project
This project is entirely made for studies propuses. It has callback hells, lot's of pre ECMA 5 constructs and no framework. The main goal here is not write a newer and clean javascript, but to feel what's like to develop in node.js in it's bare bones. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.

How To Run
Download Node.js from the official site or from here (like I did), and run the following at the terminal:

node index.js
